# Simple log maching approach
The approach can be converted to a supervised learning problem by having historically identified correct matchs

# The feature can be used for supevised learning:
* Sensor count to activity count ratio
* No of days common in observation
* No of acitivity count per time bucket in sensor and activity log
* Proportion of activity count in time buckets
* Proportion of activity type distribution on all activity types in sensor and activity logs
* Ratio of each activity count in user log and sensor log
